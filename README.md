# Generated Web Application — Data Processing and CI

## Summary
This repository contains a small Python data-processing script (execute.py) that reads sales data from an Excel file (data.xlsx), computes summary metrics, and writes a JSON summary to stdout. The project adds a GitHub Actions workflow to lint the code with ruff, run the script to produce result.json, and publish result.json via GitHub Pages.

This update includes:
- A fixed execute.py (bug fixes and improved robustness)
- data.csv (CSV conversion of the provided data.xlsx)
- .github/workflows/ci.yml to run ruff, run the script, and deploy result.json to Pages

Important: result.json is not committed to the repository. It is generated by CI and published to GitHub Pages.

## Tech Stack
- Python 3.11
- pandas 2.3
- ruff (linting)
- GitHub Actions for CI and Pages deployment

## Directory Structure
- .github/workflows/ci.yml — CI workflow (lint + run + publish)
- execute.py — Main script (reads data.xlsx, prints JSON summary)
- data.xlsx — Original Excel file (attachment)
- data.csv — CSV conversion of data.xlsx (committed)
- index.html, script.js, style.css — static web files (unchanged)
- LICENSE — MIT License

## Setup (local)
1. Ensure you have Python 3.11 and pip installed.
2. Install dependencies (recommended in a virtualenv):
   python -m pip install --upgrade pip
   pip install pandas==2.3 openpyxl

3. To test locally (will print JSON to stdout):
   python execute.py > result.json

Note: Don't commit result.json — it should be generated by CI and published via Pages.

## CI (GitHub Actions)
The workflow is defined at .github/workflows/ci.yml and runs on push to main. It:
- Checks out the repository
- Sets up Python 3.11
- Installs ruff and pandas (and openpyxl)
- Runs ruff and prints its results to the action log
- Runs: python execute.py > result.json
- Copies result.json into a public/ directory and uploads it as a Pages artifact
- Deploys the public/ artifact to GitHub Pages

Mermaid flow:

  C --> D[Install deps: ruff, pandas, openpyxl]
  D --> E[Run ruff (lint)]
  E --> F[Run python execute.py > result.json]
  F --> G[Copy result.json to public/]
  G --> H[Upload Pages artifact]
  H --> I[Deploy to GitHub Pages]
  I --> J[result.json available on Pages]
```

## Usage examples
- Run locally to inspect the summary:
  python execute.py

- The CI will run automatically on push to main and publish result.json to GitHub Pages. After the workflow completes, the published JSON will be available at:
  https://<your-org-or-user>.github.io/<repo-name>/result.json

(Replace <your-org-or-user> and <repo-name> with the repository owner/name.)

## Data conversion note
- data.csv was generated from data.xlsx (committed) to provide an easy-to-read CSV version of the attached Excel data.

CSV schema (inferred): date, region, product, units, price
Assumption: units and price are numeric, date is ISO-formatted.

## Code explanation (files changed)
- execute.py
  - Fixed a non-trivial bug: the script previously referenced misspelled columns (e.g. "revenew") and used an incorrect aggregation call. The script now:
    - Normalizes column names
    - Ensures proper datetime and numeric conversions
    - Computes revenue = units * price
    - Calculates top 3 products by revenue
    - Computes the 7-day time-based rolling average of daily revenue per region and returns the last value for each region
    - Emits a JSON object to stdout
  - The script includes a small helper _safe_float to ensure JSON-serializable floats and None for missing values.

- data.csv
  - CSV version of the provided data.xlsx (committed). Use it if you prefer CSV input, though execute.py reads data.xlsx directly.

- .github/workflows/ci.yml
  - Adds CI steps to run ruff, execute.py, and publish result.json to Pages.

## How to verify CI behavior
1. Push to main (this commit triggers CI).
2. In the GitHub Actions UI for the repository you should see the workflow run.
3. The logs should show ruff output and then the execute.py execution step producing result.json (the step writes result.json into the artifact and the Pages deploy publishes it).
